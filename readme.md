The purpose of this web application is to help socially awkward and shy people successfully interact in a social setting and ease anxiety, by supplying various party starting conversation topics.  This app was made using the MEAN stack (Mongoose, Express, Angular, Node.js). To use the application nothing needs to be installed.  I started off making the backend, by creating hardcoded seed data and defining the routes in express.  I used handlebars for the views.  After the backend was complete I incorporated Angular for front end. The MEAN stack was chosen because no resources or models needed to be nested so a relational database was not needed.  I think the coolest feature is the search option.  The user can use a dropdown box to search and a topic and question will automatically appear! When a new Topic and question is added, it will be ordered by the name of the topic. This was done using the orderBy filter.  

As a user I should be able to view all of the questions that are not associated with a topic and view questions by their topics.

As a user I should be able to create a new topic and question.

A user should be able to search by topics.
